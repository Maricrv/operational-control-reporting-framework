# Process Stages

The electoral operation was executed as a **phase-based, time-bound process**.
Each stage had distinct objectives, risks, and control mechanisms.
Operational control and reporting were aligned to these phases rather than
handled as a single continuous operation.

---

## 1. Computing Centers (CC) Implementation Phase

### Objective
Ensure that all Computing Centers (CC) are **implemented and operationally ready**
before the start of testing activities.

### Key Activities
- Deployment and setup of Computing Centers
- Installation and validation of infrastructure and connectivity
- Assignment and confirmation of operational staff
- Verification of logistical readiness

### Key Risks
- Incomplete implementation of some CCs
- Infrastructure or connectivity gaps
- Staffing shortages affecting readiness

### Control Focus
- CC implementation status (implemented vs pending)
- Infrastructure and connectivity readiness
- Staffing coverage validation

### Key Outputs
- Implemented and operational CCs
- Validated readiness baseline for testing
- Authorization to proceed to the testing phase

## 2. Testing and Operational Readiness Phase

### Objective
Ensure that the operation reaches **Election Day with no unresolved critical issues**.

### Key Activities
- Execution of operational and system tests
- Detection and resolution of operational incidents
- Validation of reporting and communication channels
- Confirmation of CC enablement for live operation

### Key Risks
- Unresolved incidents prior to Election Day
- Incomplete validation of operational procedures
- Limited time to correct critical issues

### Control Focus
- Incident detection and resolution status
- Time-to-resolution for critical issues
- CC readiness and enablement status

### Key Outputs
- Resolved critical incidents
- Enabled and validated CCs
- Formal readiness confirmation for Election Day

## 3. Processing Phase (Election Day and Post-Election)

### Objective
Achieve **100% processing of electoral records and resolutions**
within the established timelines.

### Key Activities
- Monitoring of processing progress across all CCs
- Identification of CCs delayed or at risk
- Coordination of incident resolution and escalation
- Resource reallocation when required to meet deadlines

### Key Risks
- Processing delays affecting overall completion
- Accumulation of unresolved operational incidents
- Loss of time to recover from deviations

### Control Focus
- Processing completion percentage
- Time remaining to deadline
- CCs at risk or delayed
- Escalation and corrective actions

### Key Outputs
- Continuous national-level processing status
- Escalation and intervention records
- Confirmed progress toward 100% completion

---

## 4. Closure Phase

### Objective
Ensure **formal operational closure** after confirming full processing completion
and data integrity.

### Key Activities
- Verification of 100% processing completion
- Reconciliation and validation of operational records
- Resolution of any remaining issues
- Formal operational close and reporting

### Key Risks
- Late identification of incomplete processing
- Unresolved issues delaying closure
- Incomplete operational documentation

### Control Focus
- Completion confirmation
- Reconciliation results
- Formal approval for operational closure

### Key Outputs
- Confirmed 100% processing completion
- Reconciled and validated operational records
- Formal closure approval
