# Process Overview
This section describes the **end-to-end operational process** supported by the Operational Control & Reporting System.

The process represents a **large-scale, time-critical operation** executed across multiple distributed units, where **full completion within a fixed deadline** is mandatory.

The process is structured into **three high-level phases**, each with distinct objectives, risks, and control needs.

## End-to-End Flow
1. Preparation Phase  
2. Execution Phase  
3. Closure Phase  

Each phase introduces different operational risks and therefore requires **different monitoring and decision mechanisms**.

## Design Perspective
This process view is intentionally:
- **Business-oriented**, not technical
- Focused on **control, visibility, and decision-making**
- Independent of any specific system implementation

The goal is to ensure that management can:
- Understand where the operation stands
- Identify risks early
- Intervene effectively when needed
