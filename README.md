# Operational Control & Reporting Framework  
**Business Analyst Portfolio Project**

## Overview

This repository presents a **Business Analyst case study** focused on operational control, monitoring, and decision support in a **large-scale, time-critical, distributed operation**.

The project is inspired by real-world experience and has been **fully anonymized** for confidentiality purposes.  
It demonstrates how structured business analysis, KPIs, and reporting frameworks can improve operational visibility, reduce risk, and support timely decision-making under strict deadlines.

## Business Context

The organization manages nationwide operations that require:

- Coordinated setup of multiple operational sites across different regions  
- Dependency on external service providers  
- Strict and non-negotiable deadlines  
- Continuous monitoring of execution progress  
- High accountability and reputational risk  

Operational success depends on achieving **100% processing completion**, resolving incidents in real time, and closing operations in a controlled and compliant manner.
