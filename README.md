# Operational Control & Reporting Framework  
**Business Analyst Portfolio Project**

## Overview
This repository presents a **Business Analyst case study** focused on **operational control, monitoring, and decision support** in a **large-scale, time-critical, distributed operation**.

The project demonstrates how structured **process analysis, KPIs, and reporting frameworks** can improve operational visibility, reduce risk, and support **timely decision-making under non-negotiable deadlines**.

All content is **fully anonymized and illustrative**, inspired by real-world operational experience.

---

## Business Context
The operation represented in this case study involves:

- Multiple distributed operational units executing in parallel  
- Strict and non-negotiable deadlines  
- Dependency on real-time reporting and issue resolution  
- High operational and reputational risk if execution is delayed or incomplete  

Operational success depends on:
- Achieving **100% execution completion**
- Maintaining **continuous visibility**
- Managing incidents and risks in real time
- Supporting leadership decisions during execution

---

## Project Objectives
This project demonstrates how a Business Analyst can:

- Translate complex operational execution into **clear business processes**
- Identify **stage-specific operational risks**
- Define **decision-oriented KPIs**
- Design a **conceptual operational control system**
- Support executive and operational decision-making through reporting

---

## Scope and Approach
This repository represents a **conceptual business system design**, not a production software solution.

It focuses on:
- Process design and analysis
- Risk identification and controls
- KPI definition and action rules
- Decision flows and escalation logic
- Executive reporting and dashboard narratives

Technical implementation (applications, infrastructure, integrations) is intentionally **out of scope**.
