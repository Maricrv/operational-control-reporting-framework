# Operational Control & Reporting Framework  
**Business Analyst Portfolio Project**

## Overview
This repository presents a **Business Analyst case study** focused on **operational control, monitoring, and decision support** in a **large-scale, time-critical, distributed operation**.

The project demonstrates how structured **process analysis, risk identification, KPIs, and reporting frameworks** support **real-time decision-making** and help ensure **100% execution completion under non-negotiable deadlines**.

All content is **fully anonymized and illustrative**, inspired by real-world operational experience.

---

## Business Context
The operation represented in this case study involves:

- Multiple distributed operational units executing in parallel  
- Strict, non-negotiable execution deadlines  
- Continuous reporting and monitoring requirements  
- Operational, reputational, and delivery risk  

Operational success depends on:
- Full execution completion  
- Early detection of deviations and risks  
- Timely corrective actions and escalation  
- Clear executive visibility during execution  

---

## Project Objectives
This project demonstrates how a **Business Analyst** can:

- Analyze and structure complex operational processes  
- Identify **phase-specific risks** and define mitigating controls  
- Define **decision-oriented KPIs** linked to actions  
- Design a **conceptual Operational Control & Reporting System**  
- Support leadership decisions through structured reporting  

---

## Scope and Approach
This repository represents a **conceptual business system design**, not a production software solution.

The focus is on:
- Business process analysis  
- Operational risk and control definition  
- KPI frameworks and action thresholds  
- Decision flows and escalation logic  
- Executive-level reporting narratives  

Technical implementation details (applications, infrastructure, integrations) are intentionally **out of scope**.
