# Business Problem Statement

## Background

This case study is based on a real operational environment and has been anonymized for confidentiality purposes.

The organization manages nationwide, time-critical operations that require the coordinated setup, execution, and closure of multiple operational sites across different regions. These operations involve distributed teams, technical infrastructure, external service providers, and strict deadlines, requiring centralized oversight to ensure operational continuity and timely delivery of results.

Due to the scale and geographic dispersion of the operations, maintaining visibility, control, and timely decision-making across all stages of the operational lifecycle is a critical challenge.

## Business Problem Overview

The primary business problem faced by the organization was the **lack of consistent, centralized, and timely operational visibility across all stages of the operation**, combined with a high dependency on external providers and regional teams.

Operational risks, delays, and incidents varied by stage, and information was often fragmented, delayed, or incomplete. As a result, management frequently relied on reactive decision-making and manual follow-ups to ensure that critical milestones were met.

## Stage-Specific Challenges

### 1. Planning and Preparation

During the planning stage, the organization faced uncertainty related to early decision-making under incomplete information:

- Difficulty determining whether planned timelines were realistic, even when contingency buffers were included.
- Dependency on external inputs (number of operational units and expected workload) to define the size and capacity of each operational site.
- Challenges ensuring a sufficient pool of qualified candidates to staff all required roles, including contingency personnel.
- Inherent uncertainty in personnel assignment, as actual performance could only be validated during execution.

Although decision-making authority existed at this stage, planning decisions were made with limited visibility into final operational conditions.

---

### 2. Implementation / Deployment

During implementation, challenges shifted from planning to execution control:

- Delays in site implementation due to provider non-compliance, last-minute deliveries, or incomplete and incorrect components.
- Strong dependency on preliminary activities such as:
  - identification and rental of suitable local facilities,
  - preparation and approval of technical layout plans,
  - coordination with local utility providers for temporary infrastructure upgrades.
- Uneven capability among regional operational staff, requiring additional supervision and centralized support.
- High operational overhead related to validating service conformity, managing extensive documentation, and preventing future contractual or audit issues.
- Exposure to external risks such as geographic accessibility issues and environmental conditions.

The successful completion of this stage was critical to enabling subsequent testing and operational readiness.

### 3. Execution / Operation

During execution, the primary challenge was ensuring **continuous operational stability while achieving full processing completion within strict time constraints**.

- A key operational objective was ensuring that **all operational sites reached 100% of records processed within the required timeframe**.
- Processing progress needed to be continuously monitored across sites in order to:
  - detect delays early,
  - identify underperforming sites,
  - trigger timely corrective actions or escalations.
- Delays in processing could be caused by multiple factors, including:
  - infrastructure or equipment failures,
  - power or telecommunications issues,
  - staffing constraints or productivity gaps,
  - unresolved incidents affecting operational continuity.
- The organization aimed to reach critical milestones (general simulation and final operation day) with:
  - **zero unresolved critical incidents**, and
  - **full processing completion across all operational sites**.
- Incident resolution required continuous prioritization, close coordination with support teams, and centralized escalation when providers or regional teams failed to respond effectively.
- Any delay in reaching 100% processing at the site level posed a direct risk to meeting official deadlines, delivering complete results, and maintaining public trust.

---

### 4. Closure

The closure stage required strict control to avoid post-operation risks:

- Ensuring **100% completion and transmission of operational results** to central systems.
- Verifying the return and integrity of all operational and regulatory documentation.
- Supervising the proper decommissioning of operational sites by providers and the return of facilities in acceptable condition.
- Managing final reporting, backups, and documentation delivery by regional teams following predefined standards.
- Conducting post-operation evaluation workshops to capture lessons learned and identify improvement opportunities.

Failures at this stage could result in audit observations, contractual disputes, or regulatory issues.

---

## Cross-Cutting Challenges

Across all stages of the operation, the organization faced:

- High dependency on external service providers.
- Delayed or insufficient responses requiring escalation.
- Fragmented information flows across regions.
- Limited real-time visibility into operational status and risks.

---

## Business Impact

Without effective operational control and consolidated reporting:

- Risks were identified late rather than proactively.
- Decision-making became reactive instead of data-driven.
- Critical deadlines were exposed to failure.
- The organization faced reputational, regulatory, and operational consequences.

---

## Problem Statement

The organization required a **structured operational control and reporting framework** capable of providing centralized visibility across all operational stages, enabling early risk detection, supporting timely decision-making, and ensuring that nationwide operations could be executed and closed reliably under strict deadlines.
